# A starter Bazel project.

## Why Zeno?

In Dragon Ball Super, Grand Zeno is the Absolute God of everything. Similarly, Bazel is a monorepo for every language
and project. Therefore, I nickname it as Zeno.

## Why a starter project?

Despite being an awesome tool, Bazel - or any Google OSS project - is extremely difficult to onboard. That's why a
starter project is needed.

## How to use?

This project should be read as an example. Well, I am honestly not sure what is the best way to onboard Bazel easily yet
but I'll try to make every commit as small as relevant as possible.
